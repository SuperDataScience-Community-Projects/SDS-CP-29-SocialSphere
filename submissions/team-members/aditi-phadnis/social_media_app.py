### üîç Feature-wise Observations

- **Age vs Addicted Score**  
  Age does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend with addiction scores. The spread is fairly uniform, with some minor variations and outliers across the range.

- **Average Daily Usage Hours vs Addicted Score**  
  A clear positive trend is evident ‚Äî students with higher addiction scores tend to have significantly higher average daily usage hours. This could suggest a strong behavioral link between screen time and addiction.

- **Sleep Hours Per Night vs Addicted Score**  
  There appears to be a mild inverse relationship. Higher `Addicted_Score` groups tend to have lower median sleep hours, though variability exists. This may indicate that addiction affects or coincides with poor sleep habits.

- **Mental Health Score vs Addicted Score**  
  Mental health scores tend to decline as addiction scores increase. The median mental health score is lower in higher addiction groups, suggesting a potential negative impact of addiction on mental well-being.

- **Conflict Over Social Media vs Addicted Score**  
  Conflicts over social media tend to rise as addiction scores increase. The median for number of conflicts over social media is higher in higher addiction groups, suggesting a potential negative impact of addiction on social relationships.
       
### üìå Notes

- Each subplot shows the distribution of a numerical feature for each unique `Addicted_Score` level.
- Boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR), with medians and outliers clearly visible.
- Distinct colors are used for each group to aid visual separation.

### üìä Key Insights
1. **Inverse Relationship Between Metrics**  
Our analysis reveals a clear inverse correlation between addiction scores and mental health 
scores - as addiction levels increase, mental health scores tend to decrease.

2. **Academic Performance Impact**
The visualization demonstrates that students with lower mental health scores (associated with higher 
addiction levels) experience more significant negative effects on their academic performance.

3. **Visual Clarity**
We've employed distinct color coding for each group to enhance visual differentiation and facilitate 
clearer pattern recognition in the data.

### üìä Key Insights



1. **Gender Difference**  
   - Females have a slightly higher average addiction score (**6.52**) compared to males (**6.36**), with a minimal difference of **0.16 points**.  
   - This suggests that, on average, females in this dataset exhibit **marginally higher addiction levels** than males, but the gap is not substantial.



2. **Academic Level**  
   - Undergraduates have a slightly higher average addiction score (**6.49**) compared to graduates (**6.24**), a small difference of **0.25 points**.  
   - This indicates that **academic level alone is not a strong predictor** of addiction risk in higher education populations.



3. **Country Grouped**  
   - **India and the USA** have the highest average addiction scores.  
   - Further breakdown and analysis are provided in the heatmap section.


4. **Most Used Platform**  
   As discussed earlier, **Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook** emerged as the most widely used platforms among participants.

   - **Instagram**  
     - Highest addiction levels.  
     - **30 users** rated their addiction at **9** (on a scale where higher scores indicate greater addiction).

   - **TikTok**  
     - Second-highest addiction levels.  
     - **20 users** rated their addiction at **9**.

   - **Facebook**  
     - Lower addiction levels.  
     - Only **3 users** rated their addiction at **9**, while the **majority (50 users)** reported a moderate addiction score of **5**.

5. **Affects Acedemic Performance**
   -Students who have rated themselves 6 or above on addiction score mostly also  stated that use of social media has 
    affected their academic performance. 
6. **Relationship Status ‚ù§Ô∏è**

    | Relationship Status | Respondent Count | Average Addiction Score |
    |---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
    | Complicated         | 32               | 7.03                     |
    | In Relationship     | 289              | 6.34                     |
    | Single              | 384              | 6.46                     |

- Students who marked their relationship status as **"Complicated"** have the **highest average addiction score (7.03)** among all groups.
- Those who are **"Single"** have a slightly higher addiction score (6.46) than those **"In a Relationship"** (6.34), but the difference is minor.
- The data suggests that individuals in **emotionally uncertain or unstable relationships** (e.g., complicated) may be more prone to higher social media addiction levels.
- However, while there are differences, they are **not drastic**, so relationship status may play a **moderate role** in influencing addiction behavior.

Even in the **"Other" grouped countries** (countries with low individual sample size), some platforms report high addiction:
- **TikTok**: `7.28`
- **Snapchat**: `7.50`

This implies these platforms have a **consistently high addictive effect globally**, not just in dominant countries.

### üìâ Low Addiction Platforms
Platforms like:
- **LINE**
- **KakaoTalk**
- **VKontakte**
- **WeChat**
- **LinkedIn**

do **not appear** in this high-addiction subset ‚Äî indicating **low engagement or limited geographic use**, and thus **lower addictive tendencies** in the sample.

---

üìå *Conclusion*: **TikTok**, **Instagram**, and to some extent **Facebook** stand out as **globally addictive platforms**, with scores exceeding `8` in multiple countries.
